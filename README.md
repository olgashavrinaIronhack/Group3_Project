## Project Description
It's a dangerous and lethal game! Our Russian group member is very attracted to this game! <br />
Moreover, the logoc of the game is very clear and we could apply what we've learnt from week 1 to develop the game.

## Rules
2 to 6 players, 6 shots, 1 bullet <br />
Players fire round by round <br />
The one who takes a bullet => dies, game over <br />

## Workflow
### Preparation & Planning
Define game rules with a flowchart mockup<br />
Plan the project<br />
Assign tasks on Jira<br />

### Sprints
Develop a MVP<br />
Test and learn : improve the MVP and develop the whole program<br />
Final test for code validation<br />
Comment the entire code<br />
Refine flow chart, develop the presentation<br />
Develop README file<br />

### Finalisation & Deliverables
Generate repo on Github, push code to repo<br />
Rehearsal of presentation<br />
Upload all the deliverables<br />

## Organization
Jira: assign work & check progress<br />
Slack: in-time communication<br />
Google Slides: work together for the presentation<br />
Github: version control of files, submit to TA<br />
File structure is really simple, plain and easy to check on each file.
